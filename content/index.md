## Goals:

* Build a markdown driven website with Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Content 2
* Should run as Edge Functions (Vervel Edge and/or Lagon)
* As lightweight and fast as possible
* Lighthouse Scores of 100% in all categories
* Find out what functionality & modules can be added without compromising performance

## Decisions so far:

* Use UnoCss instead of TailwindCss
* Use SVG instead of images whenever possibles
* Avoid Nuxt Icon, adding it seems to push resource usage a lot on Lagon
