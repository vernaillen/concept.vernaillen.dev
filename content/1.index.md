- As lightweight and fast as possible
- Find out what functionality & modules can be added without compromising performance
- Content should be easy to maintain with [Nuxt.Studio](https://nuxt.studio)

## Findings so far:

- Decided to use UnoCss instead of TailwindCss, because the bundle size is much smaller
- Use SVG instead of images whenever possibles
- Avoid Nuxt Icon, adding it seems to push resource usage a lot on Lagon
